Task: To predict class (star or galaxy) of sky objects, especially visually faint ones, based on the telescopic survey images (from Palomar Observatory)

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey has created the most detailed three-dimensional maps of the Universe ever made, with deep multi-color images of one third of the sky, and spectra for more than three million astronomical objects. 

The data was obtained from http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/home.aspx
